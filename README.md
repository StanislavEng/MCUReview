# Repository to Review using Microcontrollers

After getting spoiled playing around with Arduinos for some quick learning and projects, it seems time to go back to using real microcontrollers.
However, I have quickly realized I forgot some of the steps, and, upon trying to use the STM32CubeMX, there's also some stuff to learn. 

This is going to be my repo to try out features and learn/play around with (probably exclusively in this folder) ST Micro devices.
