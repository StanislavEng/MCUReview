# Repository to Review using Microcontrollers

After getting spoiled playing around with Arduinos for some quick learning and projects, it seems time to go back to using real microcontrollers.
However, I have quickly realized I forgot some of the steps, and, upon trying to use the STM32CubeMX, there's also some stuff to learn. 

This is going to be my repo to try out features and learn/play around with (probably exclusively in this folder) ST Micro devices.

Initially tried to use Nucleo-F429ZI board but the HAL functions weren't working properly. I have since downloaded the necessary STM32F4 libraries to hopefully make it work but have since moved on to using Nucleo-L476RG. 

Will test / proof of concept using the UART, I2C, ADC (probably), interrupts, timers, and some more, before moving on to my project. 
###### Might implement some MBED/FreeRTOS for playing around here as well.
Additional proof of concepts and learning of interfaces (such as BT, WIFI, etc) will be performed during actual project work.
